Cái web trên, em thêm đoạn text này vào bên dưới 

Origin

In the deepest pit of the Crypto Underworld, where dead memes rot in endless FUD, a freak was born. Not of light, not of darkness, but from pure hatred, doubt, disdain and curses of humanity. Thus, ZERK – The FUD-Eater came to life.

🔥 Features

Form: Small, round, blood-red like the market’s bleeding candles. Both scary and goofy.

Personality: Defiant, trolling, chaotic… yet dumb enough to trip over his own tail.

Food: Only FUD. Every insult feeds him, every doubt empowers him.

Paradox: The more you try to bury him, the stronger he becomes. Ignore him, and he withers.

Xong khúc text trên, chuyển sang section mới, thể hiện đoạn text dưới

ZERK never fears the hate, he feasts on it. He opens his mouth wide, laughs like an idiot, and treats it all as an endless buffet. The more you attack, the bigger and stronger he grows.

----------------------------

Xong đến các dòng chữ dưới, sẽ thể hiện kiểu pop-up từ dưới lên, nằm đè lên nhau, nhưng vẫn thấy được chữ

“Hate don’t kill me, it fuels me”
“Hate me now, fear me later”
“Show me your hatred, I’ll bring you 
to the dark side”
“Hate is a burden, let me bear it”

Xong sau đó, sẽ đến phần image gallery, em lấy hình ở link này
